loop Statemets: While, for, do while
loping Statements in C execute the sequence of statements many times until the stated condition becomes false. A loop in C consists of two parts, a body of a loop and a control statement. The control statement is a combination of some conditions that direct the body of the loop to execute until the specified condition becomes false. The purpose of the C loop is to repeat the same code a number of times.
While Loop	In while loop, a condition is evaluated before processing a body of the loop. If a condition is true then and only then the body of a loop is executed.
Do-While Loop	In a doâ€¦while loop, the condition is always executed after the body of a loop. It is also called an exit-controlled loop
For Loop	In a for loop, the initial value is performed only once, then the condition tests and compares the counter to a fixed value after each iteration, stopping the for loop when false is returned.
